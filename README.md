# Chorus Connector

### Instructions

Chorus Connector is an exciting new product to help lovers of choral music find ensembles. Build an appealing application with the following features, and feel free to add your own creative twists!

Public Functionality:
- view all choruses
- search for choruses near me

Password-Protected Functionality:
- create, view, edit, and delete choruses

`data.json` contains an example data model and sample list of choruses. Feel free to modify any and all of it for your needs. You do not need to build long-term data persistence (it’s ok for everything to refresh on reload), and data can be stored in-memory however you prefer. 
Authentication can be as simple or complex as you feel appropriate for the purposes of this exercise.
Please take no more than 2 hours to develop your solution.

What We’re Looking For:
- does your code run?
- does your product fulfill the core feature requirements?
- is your code well-organized and readable?
- is the UI and UX pleasing?

Optional Considerations (be selective, given the time constraint):
- accessibility
- testing
- input validation

Fork this repository and expand upon it using your preferred folder structure, tooling, packages, libraries, etc.

This template provides a minimal setup for an Angular app. Note that the Angular CLI requires Node.js v14.20+, v16.14+ or v18.10+. To run the app:
```
cd chorus-connector
npm install
ng serve
```
Update this README with anything we should know about your solution (including spin-up and testing instructions, if relevant).
